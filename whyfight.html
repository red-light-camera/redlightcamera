        <li>It's the easy way out. This is the fastest way to make this issue disappear and to move
          on with your life.

        <li>You have better things to do in your life than fighting over a $75 ticket.
        </li>
        <li>The amount of time and effort ist not worth the $75.</li>

      <ul class="bp">
        <li>Because it's wrong. (For more info see <a href="problems.html">here</a>).
        </li>
        <li>paying the ticket implies that you plead guilty. (There's a big chance that you are
          not guilty even though you think you are).
        <li>Common sense will tell you that traffic violations help to discipline drivers to
          obey traffic regulations, which ultimately makes our streets safer. While this might be
          true in general, it is certainly not true in case of red light camera tickets.<br />
          The City of Boulder takes great lengths to deceive its citizens and misrepresents facts
          to keep it's income stream flowing. It's all about money, even at the cost of traffic
          safety.
          <br />I even claim that the City of Boulder abuses it's power by willingful ignoring
          Colorado State law (and other regulations) to extort fines from it's citizens.
          <br />At least for my part, by fighting my ticket, I made sure that their expenses
          exceed the $75 I might have to pay to them.
        </li>
        <li>There's nothing to loose. There are no additional court costs for fighting the ticket
          unless you decide to hire a lawyer. The cost of a laywer though will be more than what the ticket
          is worth. On the other hand, at this points it's not just about the money anymore...
        </li>
        <li>This is a great chance to learn more about the law and the court proceedings if you have
          never been to court before.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's an opportunity to practise public speaking and arguing in a professional environment.
        </li>
        <li>Because you can. It's like voting. In a police state you would likely not have the chance
          to defend yourself properly. While our system has it's own flaws, excercising your right
          is a demonstration that you think your rights are important to you. If you don't defend
          your rights, they may be taken away from you before you notice.
